Currently, it is taken for granted that academic research should be open-source and thus easily accessible and modifiable by the general public. Across academia, this seems to take moral precedence from the notion of egalitarianism and general distribution of resources; however, this only holds if the final product distributed is in fact a public moral good. Intellectual property (IP) rights can therefore have a very complicated relationship to the open source outputs of academia, which only becomes more problematic when that academic output is then transformed into a company operating at scale. We want to therefore explore the role that IP has in sustaining a healthy open source ecosystem.

Noluisse postulant assentior est in, no choro sadipscing repudiandae vix. Vis in euismod delenit dignissim. Ex quod nostrum sit, suas decore animal id ius, nobis solet detracto quo te.
