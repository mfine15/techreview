Across academia, this seems to take moral precedence from the notion of egalitarianism and general distribution of resources; however, this only holds if the final product distributed is in fact a public moral good. Intellectual property (IP) rights can therefore have a very complicated relationship to the open source outputs of academia, which only becomes more problematic when that academic output is then transformed into a company operating at scale.
