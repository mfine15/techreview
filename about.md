## Our Mission

The Harvard Technology Review (HTR) is a publication that explores the essentially human aspects of technology. HTR exists at the intersection between practice and theory, leveraging insight from both industry and academia. We aim to provide a community where undergraduates from interdisciplinary backgrounds can discuss the forefront of today’s tech scene and its societal implications
