## Our Mission

The Harvard Technology Review (HTR) is a publication that explores the essentially human aspects of technology. HTR exists at the intersection between practice and theory, leveraging insight from both industry and academia. We aim to provide a community where undergraduates from interdisciplinary backgrounds can discuss the forefront of todayâ€™s tech scene and its societal implications

## Who We Are

### Board

Michael Fine is a junior studying Computer Science, and the Director of Fellows for HTR. He's fascinated by the intersection of technology and governance. When he's not at school or obsessively refreshing Politico, you'll find him coding, hiking, or playing around with modernist cuisine.
